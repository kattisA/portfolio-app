# Portfolio

This is a  portfolio React app developed for learning purposes. With this tutorial I have learned more about:
- React components
- React Hooks
- Sass/scss, variables, mixins and nesting
- Flexbox
- Css 

## Description

The purpose of this application is to explore React library. The portfolio doesn't contain so much accurate info at the moment.

## Getting Started

After cloning the project run npm install. To start the project type npm start in the console and to stop ctrl + C. 

### Dependencies

* Node and npm

### Installing

Use React documentation to install.

## Future development
There are some things I would like to improve lika using rem instead of px or procent. At this moment I would like to rewrite the portfolio to be more personal but I will be able to use this as a refferal.
